# ðŸ§  NLP Programming

A collection of programs to understand and implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.


## ðŸ”¹ Basic
The first step in NLP involves preprocessing text to make it suitable for analysis.  
This section covers only the basic steps using **NLTK** and **spaCy**:



## ðŸ”¹ Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is done on the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset using the following methods:

- **NLTK**: Used for basic text cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **VADER**: A rule-based tool that detects whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral. Works well for short texts.  
- **RoBERTa**: A powerful deep learning model that understands the meaning of text and predicts sentiment using the `transformers` library.

## ðŸ”¹ Fake News Detection
Classifies news articles as **fake** or **real** using TF-IDF features and multiple ML models:

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

Models are trained on balanced datasets and evaluated using standard accuracy and prediction metrics.
